☕ Cafe Sales ETL & Data Cleaning Pipeline


This project contains a Python ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) script designed to clean, standardize, and transform a "dirty" dataset of cafe transactions.The script ingests raw CSV data, applies complex cleaning rules, logically imputes missing numerical values, and exports a clean "Gold layer" dataset ready for analysis or visualization.📂 Data SourceThe original raw dataset is available on Kaggle:👉 Dirty Cafe Sales Data for Cleaning Training🛠️ PrerequisitesTo run this script, you need Python installed along with the following libraries:Bashpip install pandas numpy
🚀 How to UseDownload the dataset (dirty_cafe_sales.csv) from the link above.Open the Python script and update the file paths to match your local directory structure:Pythoncsv_file = r"YOUR_PATH\dirty_cafe_sales.csv"
target_file = r"YOUR_PATH\transformed_data.csv"
Run the script. The cleaned data will be generated as transformed_data.csv.⚙️ Transformation Logic (Data Cleaning)The script performs a rigorous data cleaning process involving the following steps:1. Initial Cleaning & Type ConversionColumn Standardization: Strips whitespace from column names.Currency Cleaning: Removes $ symbols from Quantity, Unit_Price, and Total.Numeric Conversion: Coerces strings to numbers; non-numeric values are filled with 0.Row Filtering: Drops rows where Quantity, Unit_Price, and Total are all missing or zero (invalid transactions).2. Logical Imputation (Mathematical Recalculation)The script uses the relationship $$Total = Quantity \times Unit\_Price$$ to fill in missing data:✅ Missing Quantity: Calculated as $Total / Unit\_Price$.✅ Missing Unit Price: Calculated as $Total / Quantity$.✅ Total Recalculation: Ensures consistency by recalculating the Total for all valid rows.3. Item Mapping & CorrectionFixes invalid entries in the Item column (e.g., "ERROR", "UNKNOWN", or typos) by inferring the product based on the standardized Unit_Price:Price 1.0 $\rightarrow$ CookiePrice 1.5 $\rightarrow$ TeaPrice 2.0 $\rightarrow$ CoffeePrice 5.0 $\rightarrow$ SaladNote: Prices of 3.0 and 4.0 are explicitly marked as Unknown if the item name is invalid.4. Text Data Cleaning (Location & Payment)Targets Location and Payment_Method columns.Standardizes text using Title Case (e.g., "buDapest" $\rightarrow$ "Budapest").Uses Regex to identify variations of null values ("error", "nan", "unknown") and standardizes them to a single "UNKNOWN" label.5. Date HandlingConverts the Date column to datetime objects (handling dayfirst format).Coerces errors and fills missing dates with a default fallback value (2000-12-31) to maintain data integrity.6. Final ValidationDeduplication: Removes exact duplicate rows.Transaction ID: Drops any rows where the Transaction ID is missing, as these are not valid records.📊 OutputThe output is a CSV file (transformed_data.csv) containing structured data with consistent formatting, no critical missing values, and corrected product categorizations.
